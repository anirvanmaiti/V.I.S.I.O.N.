V.I.S.I.O.N.
============



Visual Impairment Supporting Interactive Obstacle Navigator.

• This hardware project aims at replacing the walking stick of a blind person.

• The main goal is to aid people with visual impairment in day-to-day life.

• It locates the direction and proximity of obstacles thus helping the visually impaired to detect(direction and distance of) up-going and down-going staircases, foot-level obstacles, knee-level obstacles, head-level obstacles, and is able to differentiate between a down-going staircase and a ditch.

• It has 2 modes, a general mode with buzzers and vibrators while the silent mode switches of the buzzers.

• It also has a GSM board to send S.O.S. messages to pre-defined numbers at the press of a button.

• We have used two Arduino boards as microcontrollers. The coding has been done in situ.
